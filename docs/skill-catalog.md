and regression suites.

### `threat-intel-fusion`

Pulls feeds (OTX, MISP, abuse.ch, VT, Shodan, GreyNoise, Censys, KEV, NVD,
vendor blogs), normalizes to STIX 2.1, dedupes, enriches, prioritizes with

Checkov, tfsec, KICS, cfn-nag. Ships least-privilege IAM diffs, network
restrictions, encryption defaults, and logging fixes as code, with drift
watch and weekly posture trend.

### `detection-engineering`

Authors Sigma, YARA, Suricata, KQL, SPL, and EQL detections from threat
behaviors, not single IOCs. Every rule ships with hypothesis, data source,
ATT&CK mapping, false-positive notes, response action, and a test. Includes
coverage matrix and tuning discipline.

clean reproduction, deduplication against prior disclosures, and high-signal
reporting on HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and YesWeHack with per-program
state tracking.
